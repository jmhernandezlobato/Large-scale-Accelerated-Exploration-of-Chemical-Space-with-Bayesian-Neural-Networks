\section{Methods}

Adaptive design tools include three main components. First, a probabilistic
model that describes the fitness values obtained by performing experiments.
Second, an inference algorithm that combines the probabilistic model with the
collected data to make predictions on new data points 

extrapolate the fitness values of a reduced set of molecules for which data has
already been collected to a much larger set of molecules.

Any intelligent method of exploring chemical space must balance exploration of a wide range of molecules (often thought of in terms of diversity maximization\cite{Blaney_1997,Wang_2009,Fitzgerald_2006,reker_activelearning_2015}) with exploiting the predictive power of the method used. We note that random searches have been used for the exploration of chemical spaces\cite{23548177}, and include results for a random search as a benchmark for these methods, since for a method to approach `intelligence', it surely must give significant improvements in efficiency over a random (Monte Carlo) regime.
