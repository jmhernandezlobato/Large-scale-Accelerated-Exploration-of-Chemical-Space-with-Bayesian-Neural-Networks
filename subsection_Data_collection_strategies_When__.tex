\subsection{Data collection strategies}

When exploring chemical space, there are two main tasks of interest. The first one consists in finding quickly molecules that achieve high values of a particular fitness function. In some cases the goal may be to find just a single optimal molecule, but in many ---especially in high-throughput screening scenarios \cite{Pyzer_Knapp_2015a}--- the desired outcome is to find 
an enriched set of molecules that achieve the highest possible fitness values. For solving this type of problems, we propose to use a data collection strategy called Thompson sampling \cite{Thompson_1933}. This is a simple heuristic that automatically balances exploration and exploitation \cite{Chapelle2011} and that is highly scalable and easy to implement in a distributed setting.
The second task of interest is to collect data that will lead to low prediction error as quickly as possible. This is particularly helpful when we need accurate predictions over a wide range of possible inputs. An example is given by the prediction of toxcity, where we want good overall prediction performance and not finding highly toxic molecules. For this first task we propose to use the maximum entropy sampling heuristic \cite{MacKay_1992}, which is also highly scalable and can be shown to select the most informative molecules for solving the prediction problem.
