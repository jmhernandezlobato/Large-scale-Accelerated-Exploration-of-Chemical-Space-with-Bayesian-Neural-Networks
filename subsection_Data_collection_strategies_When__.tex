\subsection{Data collection strategies}

When exploring chemical space, there are two main tasks of interest. First, we seek to quickly molecules that achieve high values of a particular fitness function.  Note that in some cases the goal may be to find a single optimal molecule, but in many ---especially in high-throughput screening \cite{Pyzer_Knapp_2015a}--- the desired outcome is to find an enriched set of molecules with high fitness values for subsequent analysis. 
For solving this class of problems, we propose to use Thompson sampling \cite{Thompson_1933} as our data collection strategy. Thompson sampling is a simple heuristic that automatically balances exploration and exploitation \cite{Chapelle2011}, performs well in practice, and can be easily implemented in a distributed setting. The second task of interest is to collect data that will lead to low prediction error as quickly as possible. This is particularly helpful when we need accurate predictions over a wide range of possible inputs. An example is given by the prediction of toxcity as an intermediate filter in the drug design process. In this case we want good overall prediction performance and not just a single highly toxic molecule. For this second task, we propose to use the maximum entropy sampling heuristic \cite{MacKay_1992}, which performs well in practice and is also highly scalable.
