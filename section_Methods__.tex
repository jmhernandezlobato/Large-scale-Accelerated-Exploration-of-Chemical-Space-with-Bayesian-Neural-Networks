\section{Methods}

Any intelligent method of exploring chemical space must balance exploration of a wide range of molecules (often thought of in terms of diversity maximization\cite{Blaney_1997,Wang_2009,Fitzgerald_2006,reker_activelearning_2015}) with exploiting the predictive power of the method used. We note that random searches have been used for the exploration of chemical spaces\cite{23548177}, and include results for a random search as a benchmark for these methods, since for a method to approach `intelligence', it surely must give significant improvements in efficiency over a random (Monte Carlo) regime.
