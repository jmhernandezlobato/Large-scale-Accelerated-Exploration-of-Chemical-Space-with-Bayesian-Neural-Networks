\subsubsection{Comparison with $\epsilon$-greedy approaches}

We can easily modify the greedy baseline in the previous experiments to include some amount of exploration. For example, by replacing a small fraction of the molecules in each batch with molecules chosen uniformly at random. This approach is often called $\epsilon$-greedy \cite{watkins1989learning}, where the variable $\epsilon$ indicates the fraction of molecules that are sampled uniformly at random. The disadvantage of the $\epsilon$-greedy approach is that it requires the tuning of $\epsilon$ to the problem of interest. By contrast, TS automatically adjusts the amount of exploration. 

We compared TS with different versions of $\epsilon$-greedy in the same way as before, using $\epsilon = 0.01, 0.025, 0.05$ and $0.075$. In this case we sub-sampled the CEP data set to include only 4,000 molecules chosen uniformly at random from the original data set. We then collected then data in batches of size 50 and across 50 different repetitions of the screening process. The experiments with the One-dose and the Malaria data sets were the same as before.  We computed the average rank obtained by each method across the $3\times 50 = 150$ simulated screening experiments. A ranking of 1 indicates that the method obtains the highest recall at the end of the 150 experiments. A ranking of 5 indicates that the method always obtains the worst recall values. Table \ref{tab:results_epsilong_greedy} shows that the lowest average rank is obtained by TS.
