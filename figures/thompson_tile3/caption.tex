Recall of the Thompson sampling methodology for each of the data sets included in this study. For the CEP data set, the recall for molecules with a PCE $>10\%$ is reported, whilst for the One-dose and Malaria data sets the recall for the top 1\% of targets is reported. In addition to the baseline Monte Carlo sampling baseline, we also include a greedy sampling approach, in which there is no exploration, and the molecules are sampled according to the mean of the predictive distribution given by PBP.  The overall lower performance of the greedy strategy illustrates the importance of accounting for uncertainty (variance) when choosing molecules for high-throughput virtual screening.\label{fig:thompson_1pc}
