Recall obtained by the Thompson sampling methodology on each data set. For the CEP data set, the recall for molecules with a PCE $>10\%$ is reported, whilst for One-dose and Malaria we report the recall for the top 1\% of targets. In addition to the Monte Carlo sampling baseline, we also include results for a greedy sampling approach, in which there is no exploration, and the molecules are sampled according to the mean of the predictive distribution given by PBP. The overall lower performance of this greedy strategy illustrates the importance of exploration when choosing molecules for high-throughput virtual screening.\label{fig:thompson_1pc}
