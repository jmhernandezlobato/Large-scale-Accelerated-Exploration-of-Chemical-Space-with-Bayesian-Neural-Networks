Recall obtained by Thompson sampling on each data set. For the CEP data, the recall for molecules with a PCE $>10\%$ is reported, whilst for One-Dose and Malaria we report the recall for the molecules in the top 1\%. In addition to the Monte Carlo sampling baseline, we also include results for a greedy sampling approach, in which there is no exploration, and the molecules are chosen according to the mean of the predictive distribution given by PBP. The overall lower performance of this greedy strategy illustrates the importance of exploration when choosing molecules for high-throughput virtual screening.\label{fig:thompson_1pc}
