The recall of the Thompson sampling methodology for each of the datasets included in this study.  For the CEP dataset, the recall for molecules with a PCE $>10\%$ is reported, whilst for the One-Dose and Malaria datasets the recall for the top 1\% of targets is reported.  In addition to the baseline Monte Carlo sampling, we also include a greedy sampling approach, in which there is no exploration, but the training set is selected by exploiting the predictive power of the model.  The general lower performance of this model indicates the importance of balancing exploration and exploitation when choosing molecules for high-throughput virtual screening.
