The results of maximum entropy sampling for the three data sets included in this study.  It can be seen that for all three data sets, selecting the molecules actively using maximum entropy sampling results in a lower root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) at lower sample counts than randomly sampling the data (Monte Carlo). The experiment was performed 50 times, allowing the calculation of errors via the bootstrapping methodology at the 95th percentile (p=0.05).\label{fig:max_entropy}
