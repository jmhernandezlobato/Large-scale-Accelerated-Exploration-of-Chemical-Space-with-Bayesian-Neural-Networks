The results of the maximum entropy sampling method.  In the analyzed data sets, selecting molecules actively using maximum entropy sampling results in a lower predictive root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) than randomly sampling the data (Monte Carlo). The experiment was repeated 50 times, allowing the calculation of standard errors via the bootstrapping methodology.\label{fig:max_entropy}
