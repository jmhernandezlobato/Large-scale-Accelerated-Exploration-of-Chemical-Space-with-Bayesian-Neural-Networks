A graphical representation of the probabilistic back propagation (PBP) algorithm. Deterministic inputs, here represented as $1$s and $0$s are passed through the Bayesian neural network. The main operation in PBP is the update of the mean and variance parameters of the posterior approximation each time a new data point is processed. Updates are propagated using moment matching between the old and new likelihoods, with ADF Gaussian updates.
