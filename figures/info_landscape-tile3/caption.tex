Search landscapes for the Clean Energy Project, One-Dose and Malaria datasets.  
The colors represent the mean value of the target variables associated with those molecules that fall in the corresponding $0.2 \ times 0.2$ square area. Contour lines are given by a kernel density estimate of the projected feature vectors. Blue dots represent the top 100 molecules in the data set.
