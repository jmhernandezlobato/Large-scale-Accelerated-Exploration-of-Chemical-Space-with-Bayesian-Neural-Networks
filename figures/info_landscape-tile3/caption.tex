Search landscapes for the Clean Energy Project, One-Dose and Malaria data sets.  
Colors represent the mean target value for the molecules projected into the corresponding $0.2 \times 0.2$ square area. Contour lines are given by a kernel density estimate of all the projected feature vectors. Blue dots represent the projected location of the top 100 molecules in the data set.
