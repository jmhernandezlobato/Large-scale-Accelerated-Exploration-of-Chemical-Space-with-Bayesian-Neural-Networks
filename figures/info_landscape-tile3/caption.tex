Information landscapes for the Clean Energy Project, One-Dose and Malaria datasets.  
The colors represent the mean value of targets whose reduced dimensional inputs fall within that area of reduced feature space,
the contour lines are a kernel density estimate of the location of inputs, and the blue dots represent the location of the reduced
dimensional features which represent the top 100 target values for each set.
