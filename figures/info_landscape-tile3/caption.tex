Search landscapes for the Clean Energy Project, One-Dose and Malaria data sets.  
Colors represent the mean value of the target variables for those molecules that are projected into the corresponding $0.2 \ times 0.2$ square area. Contour lines are given by a kernel density estimate of the projected feature vectors, and the blue dots represent the location of the top 100 molecules in the data set.
