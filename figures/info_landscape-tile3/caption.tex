Search landscapes for the Clean Energy Project, One-Dose and Malaria data sets.  
Colors represent the mean target value for the molecules projected into the corresponding $0.2 \times 0.2$ square area. Contour lines are given by a kernel density estimate of all the projected feature vectors. Blue dots represent the projected location of the top 100 molecules in the data set. Note that in the CEP data set we focus on maximization, while in One-dose and Malaria the focus is on minimization.
